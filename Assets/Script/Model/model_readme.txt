This is a trained Model from the Common Voice Datasets.

Common Voice is a corpus of speech data read by users on the Common Voice website (http://voice.mozilla.org/), and based upon text from a number of public domain sources like user submitted blog posts, old books, movies, and other public speech corpora. Its primary purpose is to enable the training and testing of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.

This model was trained in Python with the help of the Tensorflow and Keras packages on top of it.  

Model used is CNN (Convolutional neural network). Mostly noted by the Sequential function in TF.Keras
